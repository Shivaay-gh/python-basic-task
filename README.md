# Python Assignments

This repository contains beginner-level Python programs.

## Assignment2_task_1: Odd Even Checker
- Prompts the user to enter an integer.
- Checks if the number is divisible by 2. 
- Displays whether the number is Even or Odd.
- Handles invalid input gracefully (if included in your version).

--- How It Works

- A number is "even" if it is divisible by 2 (remainder = 0).
- A number is "odd" if it is not divisible by 2 (remainder ≠ 0).

The program uses the modulus operator '%' to determine the remainder.

Example logic:
- if num % 2 == 0:
      print("Even")
- else:
      print("Odd")

## Assignment2_task_1: Sum of numbers from 1 to 50
- Uses a 'for' loop to iterate through numbers 1 to 50.
- Adds each number to a running total.
- Prints the final sum.

--- How It Works

The program uses the built-in 'range()' function:
- total = 0
- for i in range(1, 51):
-    total += i
- print(f"The sum of the numbers in the range 1 to 50 is: {total}")

## Task 1: Basic Calculator
- Takes two numbers as input
- Performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
- Displays the results

## Task 2: Name Greeting Program
- Takes first name and last name as input
- Combines them into a full name
- Prints a personalized greeting
